    #Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
    #Blockchain is a database that is shared publicly and anyone can see the data on the blockchain. There is no governing body or any one organisation #dictating what we should or shouldn't do. 
    #Explain what a Smart Contract is.
    #A smart contract is a kind of rule book for the blockchain.They have to be written and tested carefully(on TestNet) before they are put on MainNet because #otherwise things can go wrong and people can lose a lot of money. Some people do this intentionally to scam people, so knowledge of smart contracts need to be #more widespread so that people dont get scammed. They include a function, some sort of parameter(age?), it stores that parameter and then sends it to the #updated data to the blockchain. With smart contracts there is no middle man so they can be actioned quickly, and they are usually shared with communities so that there is trust and transparency within the project.
    #Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
    #A script is a line of code that reads information from a blockchain
    #A transaction is a paid function call(when data gets changed on a blockchain). On certain blockchains this payment is known as gas and is a complete rip #off!
